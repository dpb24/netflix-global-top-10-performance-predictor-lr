# Netflix Global Top 10 Performance Predictor (Python)

### 🎬 Predicting Netflix Title Performance 📊 <br>


Can you predict how many hours a Netflix title will be viewed based on its first two weeks in the Global Top 10? What trends influence what we watch? <br>


To find out, I developed a **multiple linear regression model** to forecast the success of Netflix titles in the Global Top 10. <br> <br>


### 💡Key results:
 - **77.5%** of the variation in total hours viewed is explained by the model
 - **All predictors** were statistically significant, meaning they have a measurable impact on total hours viewed
 - **Category matters:** 📺 **TV shows** tend to perform better than 🍿 **Films** in terms of total viewing hours <br> <br>
