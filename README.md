🎬 Predicting Netflix Title Performance 📊 <br>
Can you predict how many hours a Netflix title will be viewed based on its first two weeks in the Global Top 10? What trends influence what we watch? To find out, I developed a multiple linear regression model to forecast the success of Netflix titles in the Global Top 10.

💡 Key results:
 - 77.5% of the variation in total hours viewed is explained by the model
 - All predictors were statistically significant
 - Category matters: 📺 TV shows perform better than 🍿 Films
